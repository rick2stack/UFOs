# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic website that displays UFO sighting data.  The website has inputs which filters the UFO sighting data upon change. This enables the users to filter out data based on one or multiple of the following fields: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of UFOs. 
## Results
### Link to UFO Sightings Webpage
The dynamic webpage is accessible at xxxx.

### Using the UFO Sightings Webpage
#### Filtering by One Inputs
If a user wants to filter out by one field, lets say the date field, the user will click inside the date field box, and type a respective date. (take note, that the greyed out input txt fields are default values)

#### Filtering by One Inputs
In the event the user wants to filter by two or more fields, the user will filter out by one input (as mentioned above) and repeat the same steps for the second input.

#### Remove Filters
To remove filters the user will have to delete the text in the input field box.

## Results
1. The interative UFO sighting website has one major drawback, the input text fields.  Due to the fact that inputs are in text format there is a possibility of typing inputs in the wrong format, or typos.   

2. One recommendation is to make the input text fields into drop down fields.  This will eliminate typos or incorrect formats.

3. The second recommendation is to create a clear filter button to remove filters already applied.  Currently the user either has to delete the text on the input field box. This is a tedious process when you have multiple filters.
